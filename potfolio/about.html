        <p class="title">High school Student</p>
        <p>2015, I was doing my matric at Arthur Mfebe Agricultural School. By that time I new what I wanted in life but that was not enough to fulfil my destiny,although I was so ambitious. It was the very joyful year of my entire life knowing that I was leaving high school going to Varsity, at the same time it was my last year of being to a body. Everyone was on my side, and everyone had high hopes in me especially my teachers and the principal.</p>
        <p>But, life has a way of turning upside down at the strangest moments
            forcing you to reconsider what stares at you from the mirror
            holding you back and surging you on
            making everything and nothing make sense. I did obtein a bachelor but not enough to do LBB at the university.</p>

        <p class="title">Varsity Student</p>
        <p>Since I did not obtein good marks to become a Lawyer, I decided to do one of the cources in the Agricultural industry(Bachelor of Science in in Agriculture) in the University of Fort Hare. I was doing the cource just for the sake of being in the university, as a result I lost the interest. It was so easy for me to loose interest, of cource it was my first year at varsity.</p>
        <p>I droped out of the university for the first time and went back for the second time doing my second year in the same degree, I was doing well in my studies in the first semester I just don't know what went wrong in the second semester. But the said thing was that I lost my residence and also NSFAS as well, so I had to pay for everything even the rent.I was facing so many different complexities, I had to drpout for the second time.</p>
